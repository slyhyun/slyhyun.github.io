3. Participants: Ahn Hyun, Kim Sun-yeop, Song Jae-min, Yoon Kyu-ri, Jeon Min-sang, Jung Soo-kyo, Choi Min-jeong
4. Functionality Completion:
- Implement the main screen (starting the game, ranking, explaining the game, ending the game)
- Jumping and bending implementation
- Obstacles Realize the Number of Lives
- Increase hourly score and level (speed)
5. How to execute
- When entering 1 on the main screen, the game starts, the ranking when entering 2, the game description when entering 3, and the game ends when entering 4.
- If you enter z after the game starts, the dinosaur jumps, and if you enter c, it bows.
