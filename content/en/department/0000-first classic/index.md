I was impressed by Soyou's first part of the eldest son's book, "Small wisdom does not reach great wisdom, and boys do not reach great age."
When I was in high school, there was a time when I was a basketball player. Then one day, I played a practice game with older clubs.
Until then, I was confident in my skills, so I thought that we, who are still young, would have the upper hand in our physical ability and physical strength, and I thought we would win.
However, when we started the game, we couldn't do anything thanks to the club's skillful tactics and calm play, and the club members who had a lot of experience won the game.
After the game, I realized that the difference in experience has more power than I thought, and I thought I shouldn't be complacent or dismissive of anyone in the future.
This article was impressive in relation to this experience.
